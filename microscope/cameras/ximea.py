"""Ximea cameras.

Changing settings flushes the buffer
------------------------------------

It is not possible to set some parameters during image acquisition.
In such cases, acquisition is stopped (camera is disabled) and the
restarted (camera is enabled).  However, stopping acquisition discards
any image in the camera memory that have not yet been read.

Modifying the following settings require acquisition to be stopped:

- ROIs
- binning
- trigger type (trigger source)

For more details, see the [XiAPI manual](https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/XiAPI_Manual#Flushing-the-queue).

Hardware trigger
----------------

Ximea cameras in the MQ family accept software triggers even if set
for hardware triggers (see `vendor issues
#3`<https://github.com/python-microscope/vendor-issues/issues/3>).
However, `XimeaCamera.trigger()` checks the trigger type and will
raise an exception unless the camera is set for software triggers.

Requirements
------------

Support for Ximea cameras requires Ximea's API Python (xiApiPython).
This is only available via Ximea's website and is not available on
PyPI.  See Ximea's website for `install instructions
<https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Python>`__.
