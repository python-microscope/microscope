"""A class for serving microscope components.

This module provides a server to make microscope control objects available
over Pyro. When called from the command line, this module will serve devices
defined in a specified config file.

This module can be called as a program to serve devices over Pyro,
like so::

    python -m microscope.device_server CONFIG-FILEPATH

where ``CONFIG-FILEPATH`` is the path for a python file that defines a
``DEVICES = [device(...), ...]``
