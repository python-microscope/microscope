# Simple python script to use Pyth0n-Microscope
# https://github.com/python-microscope/microscope
# to produce a time laspe image series.

# Example code for a time-series experiment with hardware
# triggers.  In the hardware, this experiment requires the camera
# digital output line to be connected to the laser digital input
# line, so that the camera emits a high TTL
# signal while its sensor is being exposed.  In the code, the laser
# is configured as to emit light only while receiving a high TTL
# input signal.  The example triggers the camera a specific number
# times with a time interval between exposures.  The acquired
# images are put in the buffer asynchronously.  The images are taken
# from the queue at the end of the experiment and saved to a file.
