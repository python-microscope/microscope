Microscope is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) and can be
`installed like any other Python package
<https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/>`_.  The
short version of it is to "use pip"::

    pip install microscope

You need to have Python and pip already installed on your system.

For details on system requirements, dependencies, and system specific
